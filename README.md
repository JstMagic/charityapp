# CharityApp

An Android application for charity management and donations.

## Project Structure

The application is organised using logical, feature-based package grouping within Android Studio.  
This structure separates UI components, business logic, and data models to improve maintainability and scalability.  
The layout below represents the **conceptual organisation of the code**, rather than the raw folder structure displayed on GitHub.
